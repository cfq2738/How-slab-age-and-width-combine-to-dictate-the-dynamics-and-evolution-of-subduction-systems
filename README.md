# How-slab-age-and-width-combine-to-dictate-the-dynamics-and-evolution-of-subduction-systems
Files necessary to reproduce models presented in "How slab age and width combine to dictate the dynamics and evolution of subduction systems: a 3-D spherical study", submitted to "Geochemistry, Geophysics, Geosystems". The input files are organised by their model names.

The Fluidity computational modelling framework, including source code and documentation, is available from https://fluidityproject.github.io/; the version used for the simulations presented herein has been archived at https://zenodo.org/record/5636819\#.YYBeydZBxR4. To generate the mesh, execute `python icosahedral_gmsh_new.py icosahedron 2.22 5` in the mesh sub-directory, where `icosahedron` is the output mesh, `2.22` is the non-dimensionalised radius of Earth and `5` is the number of subdivisions used to generate the mesh used for the simulations. The problem should be decomposed into multiple subdomains to benefit from parallelism, by executing `mpirun -np NCPUS flredecomp fluidity_file decomposed_file`, where you should replace `NCPUS` by the number of subdomains, `fluidity_file` by the flml file without the .flml extension, and `decomposed_file` by the name of your choice, also without the .flml extension.
